# Hi there! 👋 I'm Sampath Modhugu

**🚀 Seasoned DevOps Engineer | DevSecOps | Infrastructure Automation Specialist**

I bridge the gap between development and operations to bring software to life faster and smoother. With expertise across AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and modern DevOps tools, I architect scalable, secure, and automated infrastructure solutions that empower teams to deliver excellence.

## 🧭 About Me

As a DevOps engineer with deep expertise in cloud infrastructure and automation, I'm passionate about:

- **Building automated infrastructure** using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and CloudFormation
- **Orchestrating containerized environments** with Kubernetes, Docker, and OpenShift
- **Designing CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, and Azure DevOps
- **Implementing monitoring & observability** with Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, and CloudWatch
- **Securing cloud environments** leveraging AWS and Azure security best practices
- **Automating system administration** with Bash, PowerShell, Ansible, Puppet, and Chef

My goal is to leverage cloud technologies to solve complex business problems while enabling teams to work efficiently in dynamic, collaborative environments.
